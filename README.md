# Sunny-Side-App

Sunny Side App is a project intended to be used as a study project.

## Running Instructions

Since Sunny Side App uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for the forecasts, it
requires the usage of an API key. In order to the project to run correctly, it is necessary to
create a file named the weather_api_key.txt at the root level of the project and save the API key
in it.

Likewise, Sunny Side App uses the [LocationIQ API](https://locationiq.com/) for handling geolocation.
LocationIQ also requires the usage of an API key to validate the requests. Create a file named
geolocation_api_key.txt at the root level of the project and add the API key. After that, the project
should be ready to run.
