# Sunny-Side-App

Sunny Side App is a project intended to be used as a study project.

## Running Instructions

Since Sunny Side App uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) for the forecasts, it requires the usage of an API key. In order to the project to run correctly, it is necessary to create a file named the api_key.txt at the root level of the project. Add the API key to the file, and the project should be ready to run.
